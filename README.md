# Java-GUI-Kaleidoscope
Requirement:

Use a JPanel to show an animated kaleidoscope. Have somewhere between three and ten figures that you draw on the screen (use Graphics.drawPolygon for at least one of them). Each of these "main" figures should be allowed to move anywhere in the window, so that often it will overlap or cross some of its reflections. Figures will "bounce" off the walls (like the "Bouncing Ball" JPanel), but it is OK if they sometimes go partly outside the walls--Java will "clip" the image to fit the JPanel. Each figure should move at a different speed.

Have buttons to start and stop the animation. In addition, have some controls so that the user can interact with the animation to at least a small extent. Some of the things you might want to control are: Speed. Colors. Number of figures. Number of reflections. Randomness of movements. Clearing and restarting.
